=== TIPS: Truncate only the file name (not the full path) from __FILE__

--- Solution-1: Define a new variable using "strrchr()":
#define __FILENAME__ (strrchr(__FILE__, '/') ? strrchr(__FILE__, '/') + 1 : __FILE__)

--- Solution-2: Within CMake:
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -D__FILENAME__='\"$(subst ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/,,$(abspath $<))\"'")

--- Of course later on you should use __FILENAME__ instead of __FILE__
